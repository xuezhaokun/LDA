** It takes about 5 - 15 minutes to finish running the whole project **
how to run:

1. extract the .zip file 
	unzip pp4.zip


2. cd to the project directory
	cd LDA/


3. run the .jar file
	java -jar pp4.jar


If you need to look at the code, just cd to the code directory 
	cd src/pp4

The results for task 1 are stored in file topicwords.csv

If you need to check the raw data I got from the task 2, just cd to the results directory
	cd results

The files in results have the same form as the results given in console
